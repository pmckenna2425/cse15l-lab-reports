Once that is complete, open VS code, and you'll want to see something that looks like this

Now you have VS Code instaled! 


## Remotely Connecting
  Now to remotely connect, since you're on mac, from VS code, you can open the terminal by pressing ``Control + ~``. 
 In the terminal, type ssh cs15lsp23*zz*@ieng6.ucsd.edu, with the *zz* replaced the letters specific to your own course account. 
 This will promt you for your password, and after correctly entering your password you should see something like this:
