# Lab Report 3: Researching Commands
For this lab report I'll research `grep` alternatives and options. 

## `grep` as a filter for `ls`: 
By performing the usual `ls` command to list the contents of a path and then adding `| grep <String>`, we return only the files whose names contain `<String>`. Here's two examples from `./technical`: 
![Image1](grepfilter.png) 
In this example, we can see that `technical/911report` has many files but only one containing `"preface"`. What the command
`ls technical/911report | grep "preface"` did is filter the `ls` command for only those files containing `"preface"`. 

![Image2](grepfilterGovernment.png)
In this example, we see that `technical/Government` has 6 files, but only two containing the letter `"m"`. Once again, adding 
`| grep "m"` to `ls technical/Government` filtered out every file that didn't contain the letter `"m"`.

## `grep -c` to output count of matching lines only 
By adding `-c` to our usual `grep` command, `grep -c <String>we output the count of the lines containing the
