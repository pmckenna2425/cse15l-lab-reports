# Lab Report 1 - Servers and Bugs
## Part 1: 
For part 1 our goal was to write a web server called `StringServer` that concatenates a new line and a new string when the request 
`add-message?s=<String>` is prompted. 

I reused the [Server.java](https://github.com/pmckenna2425/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/Server.java) file from [Lab2](https://github.com/pmckenna2425/wavelet), and I rewrote the methods from [NumberServer.java](https://github.com/pmckenna2425/wavelet/blob/master/NumberServer.java) to accomplish these tasks. 
The result:
