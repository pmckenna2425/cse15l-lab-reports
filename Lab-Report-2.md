# Lab Report 1 - Servers and Bugs
## Part 1: 
For part 1 our goal was to write a web server called `StringServer` that concatenates a new line and a new string when the request 
`add-message?s=<String>` is prompted. 

I reused the `Server.java` file from [Lab2](https://github.com/pmckenna2425/wavelet), and I rewrote the methods from `NumberServer.java` in a new file called `StringServer.java` to accomplish these tasks.
What I did was initialize an empty `ArrayList` as a field in the `Handler` class to keep track of the messages, and for each method call to `Handler` my code adds the new message to the `ArrayList` called `messages`, and then returns each element of the `ArrayList` on a new line. 
The Code:

The blank server looks just like this
![BlankServer](https://github.com/pmckenna2425/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/StringServer%20base.png)

And after performing `/add-method?s=Hello`, we get this: 
![StringServerHello](https://github.com/pmckenna2425/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/StringServerHello.png)
after the `/add-message?s=Hello` request is received, the `handleRequest` method in the `Handler` class is called. First, it checks to make sure that the appropriate path and query were performed, then it splits the query to obtain `Hello`, and adds it to `messages`. Next an empty `String` `toPrint` is initialized, and a for loop concatenates each element of the `messages` into a new line of `toPrint`. Finally, `toPrint` is returned. 
Notice that before this, `messages` was empty, and now `messages` has 1 element: `"Hello"`, which we see returned on the screen. 

another instance, using `/add-method?s=How are you`:
![StringServerHowAreYou](https://github.com/pmckenna2425/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/StringServerHowAreYou.png)
once again, request is received and the `handleRequest` method is called. This time the query is split to obtain `How are you`, and adds it to the next element in the `messages`. Once again, and empty `String` `toPrint` is intitialized and a for loop copies each element of the `ArrayList` into a new line in `toPrint`, and the returns the updated `toPrint`, which is different from previous iterations: it now contains a new line with the most recent message. 
Notice: before this, `messages` had 1 element, and now `messages` has two elements: `"Hello"` and `"How are you"`, which we see now returned on the screen as lines of `toPrint`. 

Finally, `/add-method?s=Go away spongebob`:
![StringServerGoAway](https://github.com/pmckenna2425/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/StringServerGoAway.png)
Now, messages has 3 elements, the newest being `"Go away spongebob"`. 



## Part 2: 
For this part, 
Choose one of the bugs from lab 3.

Provide:
* A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
* An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
* The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
* The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
 
Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.

So for part 2, the bug I'll focus on is the `reverseInPlace` method in `ArrayExampels`:
```
  // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```
